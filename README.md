# Drop-Me
Travel Management System in Python
The DropMeTM console program provides a state-of-the-art solution for the taxi service sector in the Kingdom of Miranda. The program, which was developed by a single student, seeks to provide users with a quick and simple method to gather trip details, calculate prices, apply discounts, select vehicles, and make comprehensive invoices. The application's user-friendly command-based interface, which was designed to particularly meet the needs of visitors passing through the
Kingdom's five largest cities, is evidence of the student's expert programming skills.

The program employs data structures such as a price table, car pricing dictionary, and promo code dictionary to enable exact pricing and discount computations. To spice up their cab ride, the app also provides customers with the opportunity of obtaining random discounts. The usage of use information and error handling promotes seamless interaction and improves the overall user
experience.
