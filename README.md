# Drop-Me
Travel Management System in Python
The DropMeTM console program provides a state-of-the-art solution for the taxi service sector in the Kingdom of Miranda. The program, which was developed by a single student, seeks to provide users with a quick and simple method to gather trip details, calculate prices, apply discounts, select vehicles, and make comprehensive invoices. The application's user-friendly command-based interface, which was designed to particularly meet the needs of visitors passing through the
Kingdom's five largest cities, is evidence of the student's expert programming skills.
