# Drop-Me
Travel Management System in Python
The DropMeTM console program provides a state-of-the-art solution for the taxi service sector in the Kingdom of Miranda. The program, which was developed by a single student, seeks to provide users with a quick and simple method to gather trip details, calculate prices, apply discounts, select vehicles, and make comprehensive invoices. The application's user-friendly command-based interface, which was designed to particularly meet the needs of visitors passing through the
Kingdom's five largest cities, is evidence of the student's expert programming skills.

The program employs data structures such as a price table, car pricing dictionary, and promo code dictionary to enable exact pricing and discount computations. To spice up their cab ride, the app also provides customers with the opportunity of obtaining random discounts. The usage of use information and error handling promotes seamless interaction and improves the overall user
experience.

To summarize, the DropMeTM console initiative is a commendable endeavor to revolutionize the Kingdom of Miranda's taxi service industry. With its robust features and meticulous attention to detail, the application has the potential to significantly improve the quality of taxi services for both
clients and service providers.

# Problem
The present project's purpose is to produce a console application particularly tailored to meet the demands of tourists going through Miranda's Kingdom. The major aim is to provide an intuitive and user-friendly user interface that allows passengers to easily access complete trip information and generate accurate receipts for their taxi rides. This necessitates the program's ability to smoothly combine a wide range of instructions, such as requests for price information, savings via promotional codes, and vehicle preferences. 

Furthermore, the system must include a way for selecting the lucky winners of random promotions and precisely computing rates in line with the price table supplied. Furthermore, the application must be able to generate detailed invoice files with all relevant information, allowing openfinancial interactions between clients and taxi service providers.

# Solution
To meet the needs of the Kingdom of Miranda's taxi service, one student created the DropMeTM console program. Customers may use the program to easily obtain trip information, calculate expenditures, apply discount coupons, select vehicle choices, and submit bills. The student used Python to construct a user-friendly command-based interface for fluid interaction.

The application contains a price table in KMD, the Kingdom's official currency, with city pairings and associated costs. It also contains a vehicle pricing lexicon to help you estimate the cost of transportation for trishaws, autos, and vans. Furthermore, the program has a promo dictionary with traveler discount codes. The student handled a number of circumstances expertly, allowing customers to choose vehicle models, utilize promo codes to save money, and receive random coupons for more savings. The algorithm ensures that autos travel the shortest distance possible between cities.

To increase user convenience, the student created a system that generates detailed invoice files that include trip information such as date, time, start and finish cities, total amount, applied promocodes, random discounts, and final payment. Error handling is also incorporated, which provides informative notifications for erroneous instructions or city names. The program also includes a command that shows the available commands and uses data for the user's convenience.
Finally, the student's DropMeTM console application demonstrates good programming and problem-solving abilities. Because of its user-friendly design, excellent functions, and rigorous error control, it is a respectable alternative for improving the quality of taxi service in the Kingdom
of Miranda.
